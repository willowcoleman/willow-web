Hi, I'm Willow! 

Over the last 4+ years, I've worked on a variety of topics at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and data science. I'm especially interested in projects that use this data to address environmental and social issues (e.g., improving urban environmental policy outcomes). I recently graduated from Harvey Mudd College with a B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Biology and an emphasis in Environmental Analysis. 

I'm currently working as a imaging spectroscopy research technologist on <a href="https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/">EMIT</a> at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As part of this job, I'm validating EMIT's surface reflectance data products and developing novel methodologies for measuring methane emissions from space. 

In my spare time, I like cooking, backpacking, and hanging out with my cat :sunrise_over_mountains:
