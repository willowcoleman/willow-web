Hi, I'm Willow! 

Over the last 4+ years, I've worked on a variety of topics at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and data science. I'm especially interested in projects that use this data to address environmental and social issues (e.g., improving urban environmental policy outcomes). I recently graduated from Harvey Mudd College with a B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Biology and an emphasis in Environmental Analysis. 

I'm currently working as a software engineer in the <a href="https://shapirolab.caltech.edu">Shapiro Lab</a> at Caltech. As part of this job, I am developing a software toolbox for acquiring and processing functional ultrasound (fUS) imagery. In addition, I'm creating and implementing Agile software development practices within the lab. 

In my spare time, I like cooking, backpacking, and rock climbing :sunrise_over_mountains:
